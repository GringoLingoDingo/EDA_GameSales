# Exploratory Data Analysis of Video Game Sales üìäüéÆ
### Link: https://www.canva.com/design/DAGiv1pQjvk/h_kT5SsPZFyz_-DHpmRZVQ/edit

## Project Overview
This repository presents an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) focused on evaluating the relationship between the frequency of video game genre publications and their corresponding sales performance. Additionally, the analysis investigates how critical reception, specifically Metacritic scores, impacts game sales.

## üìå Objectives of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**Variable Identification**
- **Numeric:** Sales figures, publication frequencies, Metacritic scores.
- **Categorical:** Game genre, year of release, platform, publisher.

**Data Cleaning**
- Handled missing data effectively.
- Detected and managed outliers.
- Eliminated duplicate records.
- Corrected incorrect data types.

**Creation of New Variables**
- Calculated mean sales per genre across different periods.
- Determined yearly genre release proportions.
- Derived annual genre-specific sales proportions.
- Integrated Metacritic scores to evaluate their influence on sales.

**Elimination of Variables**
- Removed irrelevant or redundant data points.

**Data Visualization**
- Created visualizations of sales distributions.
- Generated pie charts for genre proportions.
- Plotted genre publication frequency trends over the years.
- Developed scatter plots to assess correlations between scores and sales.

**Modeling**
- Conducted initial correlation analysis between genre frequency and sales.
- Explored relationships between Metacritic scores and game sales.

**Interpretation and Business Insights**
- Identified which genres show discrepancies between frequency and sales.
- Assessed the impact of critical reception on sales outcomes.
- Delivered actionable recommendations for strategic publishing decisions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Steps Undertaken

### 1. **Data Cleaning**
- **Duplicates:** Identified and removed duplicate entries.
- **Missing Values:** Handled by imputing medians per genre or removing if data was insufficient.
- **Outliers:** Detected and handled using statistical methods (e.g., Z-scores, box plots).
- **Data Types:** Corrected inconsistencies ensuring numeric and categorical accuracy.

### 2. **Comparison of Publications to Sales**
- Compared genre-specific publication proportions to their proportion of total sales per year.
- Evaluated consistency in genre publication and sales performance.

### 3. **Genre Frequency Analysis**
- Examined publication frequencies for various game genres over historical timelines.

### 4. **Sales Distribution Consistency Check**
- Assessed whether higher frequency of genre releases consistently translated to higher sales.

### 5. **Web Scraping Metacritic**
- Scraped Metacritic to gather critical review scores and release dates for analysis.
- Integrated critical scores into the dataset.

### 6. **Correlation Analysis (Scores to Sales)**
- Evaluated correlation between critical reception (Metacritic scores) and actual sales figures.
